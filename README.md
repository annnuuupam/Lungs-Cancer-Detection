# 🫁 Lung Cancer Detection 🧠🔬  
Welcome to the **Lung Cancer Detection** project! This machine learning-powered system is designed to accurately detect lung cancer using medical imaging and patient data. Leveraging powerful models and data preprocessing techniques, our goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.
